# Coffee Cafe Monitoring System

Our project is completely concern about making a system which surely monitors the impact of policies against overall administrative goals.
For adding any food menu, the system would be able to store individual food details in the database of the system to view the recent able-able items in the cafe. 
The customer can look over the food items with its price to satisfied their query about the cafe.
